# unzipper3000

## starting the script
You can either run this script singlethreaded with `./unzipper3000` or multithreaded with `./multithreaded.sh` which will be way faster. The multithreaded script may not always exit immediately so you may have to check manually if a file named password exists in where you will find the password to the zip.
